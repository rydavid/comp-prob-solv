# B~2V~ Differences for Various Potentials

- The hard-sphere potential includes only repulsive forces, leading to a positive B~2V~, while the square-well and Lennard-Jones potentials include attractive forces, which result in negative B~2V~ values. That is, once the particles are in close enough proximity, they attract and stay at some equilibrium bond distance until disturbed. The hard-sphere potential, however, only allows for collisions between particles.
